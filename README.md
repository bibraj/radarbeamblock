# radarbeamblock
This is an UI based tool for calculation of beam blockage for new sites based on wradlib open source software https://github.com/wradlib/wradlib/

The software and DEM file can be downloaded from the Link https://mega.nz/file/SI1SiKzb#1Qfbc-AaRLfMkbcCbGHCfAy5IXnGppyq6V-cenmpJdI

Requirements:
OS: Windows 8, 10
RAM:Minimum 4 GB
Space: 
 Software:200MB
 DEM File: 2.3GB(250m Resolution) for India
 
Installation:
1)Copy the "beamer.rar" file into your PC and extract it to a Folder
DEM File:
1) The DEM file present in the Folder covers India and is named as "INDIA.tif"
2) The Resolution of the DEM file is 250m
3) To change the DEM file with a higher resolution one, rename the higher resolution file as 
"INDIA.tif" and replace the existing one in the folder.
4) The software takes only the file named "INDIA.tif" for processing
5) The software was primarily developed for generation of beam blocakage plots in India. It can be used for other places as well but the DEM file should be named as INDIA.tif
   
User Instructions:
1) Click on the beamer.exe file in the Folder
2) An GUI opens with the following parameters
3) Enter the valid values in the UI.

8) Two images are created
a) Graph 1 is the terrain of the Range as per the DEM
b)Red line is the cross section at the angle which is displayed in Graph 3
c) Graph 2 is the beam blockage calculation at a given elevation
d)0 being no blockage to 1.0 being full blockage
e)Graph 3 shows the cross section of beam blockage at a given angle
f)Graph 3 shows the terrain features at the given angle
g)Graph 4 is representation of Graph 3 with respect to Earths curvature
9) Once the image is generated the user can change any of the values in the input GUI to 
generate next set of images.

Troubleshooting:
1. The software does not handle error or exceptions, in case a wrong value is provided 
as an input than which is mentioned in the validity criteria in the above table, the 
GUI closes by itself.    
2. To analyse any error , the .exe can be run from a cmd which gives the error in the 
cmd window.
4. "Value Error:Zero size array" in cmd console is likely due to incorrect DEM file.
5. The software cuts the main DEM file into a smaller file and then processes the data, 
if the region of calculation is too large and RAM size is insufficient, system may 
crash
6. The main DEM file is cut into a temporary file called "output.tif" in the same folder 
before processing, which is deleted everytime before a new input is provided. 
Sometimes if the data in the graph appears blank, it may be due to failure of the 
software to delete the old"output.tif" file. Deleting the file manually will fix the 
problem
7. In case of a valid input causing the GUI to close, Kindly send the details to

Important Note:
The beam blockage plots are generated by the functions in the wradlib open source package. This software is only an UI front end to help the users. credits for the plots belongs to  wradlib (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1209843).
